# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_System
## This is a machine learning project I am doing for my university, in general I would like to create a model that is able to predict whether the tumor
## is malignant or benign (2:Benign, 4:Malginant), Of course, using some machine learning classification algorithms.

## To do that I am using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Original) Dataset from the machine learning UCI repository which you can find using the link below:
### Dataset Source:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29

## The Dataset is made up of 699 records and 11 attributes:
1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

### Already, I performed some data visualizations (possibly will look into more different ones) and tried using KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM 
### Which all gave same accuracy of 97%.

#### One more thing, I am looking forward to compare my results with the study conducted here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918309323
#### Which I found from google scholar
